[:heart: Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/wmedrano)

This is a Rust wrapper for [Lilv](http://drobilla.net/software/lilv),
the LV2 host library. For a simpler/fuller experience, consider using
the [livi-rs](https://github.com/wmedrano/livi-rs) library.

## Completeness

This crate targets version 0.24.2 of Lilv.

Most components are implemented, but not fully tested yet. There is currently no support for State.
